> This uses puppeteer to extract spotify playlist info so it'll download chromium (150-200mb)

5. Run `node app.js`

6. You'll be asked for your URL, paste it and then press Enter to continue

- Now a folder named "songs" will be created.

- Playlist info will be extract and all the matching songs will start donwloading!

- If by chance you stop the script in between, then no worries as if song is already downloaded then next time it won't be downloaded again!

- Also there is 5% chance that song's some remix or different same name song will get downloaded...
